print Homework 2. 

This data set is from a particularly famous race in US skiing history where two USA 
skiers were on the podium for a 10K race at the world championships. This has never
occurred in the history of USA international skiing as European countries like Norway, 
Sweden and others usually dominate Cross Country Skiing.

My question was:
Would the bib number of an athlete (which was determined by standing in the point system
prior to the race starting) correlate to their birth year? 

Homework questions:

1. Null values int his data set would be the (time) back from the leader, as the leader 
a value of 0 seconds back as they had won the race. other null values come from a hiccup 
where kimono would not recognize that Did Not Finish (DNF) was not a value for ranking,
therefore that line of data has null values for the rest of the rows. 

2. The data is simplistic therefore it is relatively normalized. There are a few outliers
here an there (ex really old or young skiers) but the data is relatively clustered around
a common value.
